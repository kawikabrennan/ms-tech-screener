This is a tech screening question received by Microsoft in October 2020.

Using the following function signature, write a C# function that prints out every combination of indices using Console.WriteLine() whose values add up to a specified sum, n. Values of 0 should be ignored.\
`public void PrintSumCombinations(List<int> numbers, int n);`
* It’s okay to use additional private functions to implement the public function
* Be sure to print out the indices of numbers and not the values at those indices
* Don’t worry too much about memory or CPU optimization; focus on correctness

To help clarify the problem, calling the function with the following input:


`List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 1, 2, 2, 4 };`\
`PrintSumCombinations(numbers, 4);`


Should result in the following console output (the ordering of the different lines isn’t important and may vary by implementation):\
0 1 2 (i.e. numbers[0] + numbers[1] + numbers[2] = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4)\
0 1 3\
2 3\
4
